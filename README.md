# Simple-Date-Counter-React-
A Simple Date Counter , which allows you to see Past &amp; Future  [ Day , Week , Month, Year ] using Step and Counter 
I haven't written any CSS Code and Used React Library to develop the Application , Do check it out once . 

The Code is written in a Simple manner Using only Use State Hook 

Step State -->  Used for Exponential Incease of the Count State  (i.e if step Count - 2  then if you try to increase the Count Value , it will increase according to the Step (2+ Current value of Count ) )


Count State --> Used for Increasing the dates
